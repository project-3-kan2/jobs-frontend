## Hurdles/Unsolved Problems:
- Most of the API's doesn't have good documentation. 

- GitHub API is limited and keeps returning the same results even with the same search terms.

- Faced issues with React state and passing function as props.

- CSS proved difficult to deal within React, eventually we decided to use Bootstrap.
